i am interested in [monetary economics](https://nathantankus.substack.com/p/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy) , economic history,  [social science](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Social_science)  and  [continental philosophy](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Continental_philosophy)     

- currently: do nothing

##### [Here](https://zooeyvaflous.notion.site/312f766bc8ff43ce8c296ac5221b58a1?v=ce5ed81452e841fca74954079dc0eeaa&pvs=4) is my digital library

  - Time flies, It's important to do things fast
  - There is no such thing as a free will
